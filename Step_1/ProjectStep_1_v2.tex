\section{The Oaklaura Bike Cooperative}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=secondarycolor, colframe=primarycolor, arc=5mm]

\large
The Oaklaura Bike Cooperative is a non-profit organization that accepts donations of old or broken bicycles, refurbishes them, and then sells them at an affordable price. Due to limited funding, the co-op operates with a small team of employees and relies heavily on volunteers to assist with bicycle repairs. The co-opâ€™s limited funding also requires they use a basic POS system that can only process one bike sale at a time, setting a limit of one bike per sales order.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Store Personnel consist of both volunteers and employees. Most volunteers are not experienced bike mechanics, so they often can't fully repair a bike during the few hours the co-op is open for volunteer work. To maintain continuity and organization, volunteers are expected to repair what they can during their shift and document their progress in a report. This allows the next volunteer and/or employee to review the logs and continue the work where the previous one left off. Once a volunteer believes a bike is fully repaired, a trained employee inspects it to ensure it meets safety standards before placing it on the sales floor.

\vspace{0.2cm}

Historically, the co-op tracked repair progress and sales using handwritten notecards stored in a filing cabinet. However, as the organization grows, this system has become increasingly difficult to manage. Implementing a database would be an ideal solution for organizing and sharing information between volunteers and employees about the status of each bicycle.
